# Description: 

Created a campus communication app under a compact software engineering process. No coding was done but rather the goal of project was to understand the software engineering process that included the business landscape, requirements, design, the coding phase, testing, deployment, and maintenance of a project. A team was assigned, and each member had the opportunity to become the team manager along with the responsibilities of being one. First, as a team we decided an agile approach would be best suited for our project. Under the project I had the chance to work on the acceptance criteria, pricing, agreement, and functional requirements. In the design phase I created sequence diagrams and context diagrams to understand the functionalities of our solution and what systems will it be interacting with. In the coding phase, I specified what back-end technologies we will be using and along with summarizing our technology stack in the document. In the testing phase, I specified our process which started with regression testing after each sprint and concluded with acceptance testing. Afterwards, we created test cases for both the functional and non-functional requirements specified earlier. Finally, it concluded with me specifying the transition between developers to the maintenance team.
