# Descriptions: 

### Sieve of Erotosthenes Algorithm: 
Created a Java program implementing the Sieve of Erotosthenes algorithm to compute all prime numbers less than equal to a given integer N.

### Singly Linked List Inventory:
Created a Java program using a singly linked list of a specific generic type for an inventory that has a price, name of item, id, and item description. This generic singly linked list Java class will hold objects of the generic type <AnyType> and will extend an interface. In addition, the class will have its own set of functions that include making the linked list empty, finding a specific node, inserting a node at the front, deleting from the front, regular delete, and print total amount of nodes. The program will read from file that has many commands and the program will read the commands and execute the commands. The program will output a file with any necessary information.

### Lazy Binary Search Tree:
Created a Java program that creates a binary search tree with lazy deletion. A class is created for the tree node and another for the lazy binary search tree. The lazy binary search tree has the following functions (methods): insert (throws IllegalArgumentException) if the id of the node is invalid, delete (throws IllegalArgumentException), findMin, findMax, containsID (throws IllegalArgumentException), toString, height, and size. The program will read an input file with certain commands and the program will recognize the commands and create the binary search tree. In return the program will produce an output file writing a response for each command.

### Hash Table:
Created a Java program that implements a Java hash table structure using linear probing collision strategy. A generic class is used called HashLinearProbe <K, V>, where K is the key and V is the value. This class will have a private static class HashEntry <K,V> which will be used to create an array to represent the hashtable: HashEntry <K,V> hashtable[]; The class will have the following functions, insert, find, delete, getHashValue, and rehash. 

### Quick Sort:
Create a Java program that implements several variations of the Quick Sort algorithm, each with a different choice of pivot. The program sorts any array using in-place quick sort and the following four different pivot selection strategies:first element, random element, median of three random elements, median of first, center, and last element. A function will then calculate the time to sort the array and an output file (report file) will created inserting information of the array and the times for each quick sort depending on the pivot selection. 

### Overall: 
Created multiple Java programs that range from data structures and algorithms. Created Java programs that used the Sieve of Erotosthenes algorithm and the Quick Sort algorithm to using data structures like the linked lists, binary search trees, and hash tables. Please see the GitHub for more details of each project.
