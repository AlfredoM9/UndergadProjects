# Description: 

Created a Java solution using semaphores to the unisex bathroom problem in which the user specifies the number of toilets available in a restroom. The problem is that men can enter if toilets are available and same goes for women, but one gender cannot enter if the opposite gender is in the restroom. The solution was done using threads and semaphores. The solution is also deadlock free so the threads should concurrently be doing work dependent on the semaphore.
