# Description: 

Created a database using SQL for a library that has the following modules: person, employee, member, books, borrow details and payment. The specifications and constraints of the database were written before. As a team, we first drew an EER diagram to have a conceptual design of the database and accurately represent the set of requirements. After, the EER diagram was converted into a database design which we then normalized all tables to the third normal form. In addition, dependency diagrams were created for each table. Finally, SQL statements were created to create the database along with the specifications and constraints followed in our database design. As well as SQL statements for views specified by the client and any other queries needed in the problem description. All queries followed the constraints in the description and database design.
