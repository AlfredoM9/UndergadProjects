# Description
Created a program in C in a Linux system that perform two different functions via different threads. One of the functions will take a positive integer N, as the parameter and find the sum of these first N consecutive integers. The other function will also take a positive integer N, but will calculate and store an array of integers following the Fibonacci sequence of length N. In main, the program will first ask the user for a greater than zero integer before creating the threads. If the user enters a zero or lower, then an error message will appear, and the user will have to insert another number again until the number is valid. Once a valid number is obtained, the threads will be created and a message indicating the creation of the 2 threads will appear. One of the threads will execute the sum of N integers, while the other thread will calculate the Fibonacci sequence. Once both threads are finished a message will appear indicating they are finished followed by main outputting the sum of the N and the output of the Fibonacci sequence.
